## Running Instructions
This model will be run by the 'run_model.py' file.
If you want to change the configuration of the model then change the values in the 'configuration.py' file before executing the 'run_model.py' file.

### run_model.py
 use to run the whole code
### configuration.py
 here is all the configuration for tuning the model.
### data_processor.py
 It is all about data processing.
### PIMENTO.py
 That is the Teacher-student Physics informed model
### utilities.py
 Here are the results, plots, etc.
